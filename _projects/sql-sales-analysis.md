# Sales Data Analysis (SQL Only)

## üìä Overview
- **Stack**: SQL Server (Azure SQL)
- **Goal**: Build consolidated **customer** and **product** reports via SQL, then derive actionable insights with **RFM** and **ABC/Pareto**.

## üóÉÔ∏è Data
- **gold.fact_sales** ‚Äî orders, sales_amount, quantity, order_date, keys  
- **gold.dim_customers** ‚Äî customer attributes  
- **gold.dim_products** ‚Äî product attributes, category, cost

## üß© Customer Report (View)
Key metrics: total_orders, total_sales, total_quantity, **recency** (months since last order), **lifespan**, **AOV**, **avg_monthly_spending**, **age_group**, **customer_segment** (VIP/Regular/New).

**View:** `gold.report_customers`  
**SQL:** [12.Report_Customer.sql](/sql/12.Report_Customer.sql)
